  Hi, I'm Francesco. I'm that person who gets genuinely excited when an algorithm I've been tweaking finally runs in half the time it used to: there's something deeply satisfying about watching efficiency emerge from chaos.

  I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Big Data and High-Performance Computing at the University of Padua, and I've also been fortunate enough to join the Scuola Ortogonale excellence program. 
  It's one of those opportunities that keeps pushing me in ways I didn't expect, both in how I approach problems and how I think about learning itself.

  My journey into computer engineering started with a fascination for puzzles and logic games, which follows me since I was a kid competing in Math and Physics Olympiads, which naturally led me into competitive programming. 
  There's this moment in every challenging problem where you realize there isn't just one "right" way to solve it. Sometimes the elegant solution is completely different from the obvious one, and I love the challenge of finding it. 
  That realization opened up my world to algorithm design and data structures, where I discovered that the same problem can have wildly different solutions depending on how you frame it.

  These days, I find myself drawn to the intersection of massive datasets and the algorithms that can actually make sense of them. 
  There's something almost magical about techniques like Locality Sensitive Hashing that help us efficiently find patterns in impossibly large data sets. 
  I've been exploring clustering methods and other approaches that transform impossibly large problems into manageable ones, and honestly, it never gets old.

  What drives me isn't just making things work, but understanding why they work the way they do. 
  I'm curious about how we can build systems that don't just process data faster, but that adapt and learn from the patterns they encounter. 
  The future I'm working toward is one where algorithms don't just solve problems: they help us discover problems we didn't even know we had.

          Through the Scuola Ortogonale excellence program, Matteo Canton and I created a game-playing AI agent using the classic minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 
          We also experimented with an advanced learning agent inspired by AlphaZero, aiming to push strategic gameplay further, although it didn't achieve the same outstanding results. 
          Our efforts earned our team second place in the Scuola Ortogonale championship, a really rewarding experience that taught me a lot about reinforcement learning and game theory.

          This excellence program changed completely the way I look at Computer Science.

          I gained experience in academic research by reading, presenting, and writing about cutting-edge scientific literature, specifically in the field of Locality Sensitive Hashing. 
          What I value most is the possibility to present complex research to peers, that pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me that understanding something deeply means being able to explain it clearly to others. 
          
          Beyond the research side, I challenged myself by developing a Hive Game Agent, experimenting with both classic minimax algorithms and modern approaches inspired by AlphaZero: a project that perfectly blended theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.
          
          I also participated in presentations exploring the latest frontiers of Computer Science, which helped me learning about the latest advancements in the field, even in subjects that I was not directly involved in.

          My master's journey has been defined by diving deep into High Performance Computing and Big Data Analysis, fields that fascinate me with their potential to solve real-world problems at scale. Maintaining a perfect 30/30 average feels rewarding, but what truly excites me is how each course builds upon the last, creating a comprehensive understanding of complex systems.
    
          Competitive programming has become more than just a hobby; it's where I test my problem-solving skills under pressure. Being among the top six students at the university and being chose to represent Padua at SWERC 2024 was both humbling and exhilarating: there's something special about collaborating with teammates to tackle algorithmic challenges that seemed impossible at first glance.
          
          Co-authoring research on search engine evolution for the CLEF 2025 conference taught me that academic work is as much about asking the right questions as it is about finding answers. It's been incredibly fulfilling to contribute to knowledge that others in the field will build upon.

          My undergraduate years were where I discovered my love for research and academic rigor. 
          What began as coursework evolved into something much more meaningful when I started working on my thesis: a project that I'm proud to say was accepted for submission to EDBT 2026 and is now available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05260">arXiv</a>.
    
          The perfect 30/30 average and merit-based scholarships were wonderful recognition, but the real reward was the confidence I gained in my ability to tackle complex problems and contribute original thinking to the field. 
          
          Those three years laid the foundation for everything that followed, teaching me that persistence and curiosity are just as important as technical skills.

  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      When I'm not buried in code, you'll probably find me strategizing over a board game (Catan, 7 Wonders, and Wingspan are current favorites) or lost in a good mystery novel. 

      I'm also a big fan of sports: I spent 12 years on basketball courts, collecting provincial and regional championships and playing in international tournaments, which taught me as much about teamwork and quick decision-making as any programming project ever has.
      
      My family has always pushed me to read, and I'm a big fan of books that challenge my mind. My love for detective fiction runs deep; Agatha Christie has been my favorite author since I was young enough to write my middle school thesis about her work. 
      There's something about the methodical way she constructs puzzles that appeals to the same part of my brain that enjoys algorithm design: every clue has its place, every red herring serves a purpose.

      Actually, this fascination with games and mysteries led me to create something I'm particularly proud of: The Virus Game, a custom social deduction game inspired by Netflix's The Devil's Plan. 
      Building it combined everything I love: the strategic thinking from years of board games, the logical puzzle-solving from detective stories, and the technical challenge of bringing it all together in code. 
      It's one of those projects where my hobbies and programming skills came together in a way that surprised even me.
